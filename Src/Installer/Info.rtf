Expert Sokoban is a Sokoban game aimed at the expert: moving the pieces is considered a trivial enough task that it doesn't add to the value of the gameplay. The challenge is to work out \i where\i0  to move the pieces.\par

So don't be surprised that you can't move the Sokoban explicitly - instead remember to \b click on the pieces!\b0\par
